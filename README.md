# plv8-tools
Loose collection of PostgreSQL scripts, procedures, triggers, operators in PLV8.

Triggered by comment discussion on http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/349-Adding-properties-to-existing-JSON-object-with-PLV8.html

This is aiming to provide a loose collection of handy snippets in plv8, the JavaScript stored procedure language for PostgreSQL, the worlds best RDBMS.

Mainly, we gather stuff to deal with JSON, as that data type is wanting some comfort functions and operators.
